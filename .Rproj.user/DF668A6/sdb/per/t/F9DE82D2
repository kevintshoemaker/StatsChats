Faculty are more than welcome to join us (in any capacity)!   \n * **What?** Topics we have in mind include questions about Statistics, Experimental Design, Model Simulation & Analysis, Debugging R code, etc.  We may eventually narrow the focus if needed, but for now, anything you can reasonably describe as quantitative is fair game! Please plan on focusing on a single, well formed question (or two) so we can make good use of the hour. Occasionally we will host informational sessions on a range of topics, which will be listed on this website! Let us know if you have any ideas for topics! \n * **When?** Tuesdays from 11 to noon\n * **Where** FA 219 (NRES conference room)  \n \n \n## Join the $Stats Chats$ mailing list: \n The list homepage is at [http://lists.unr.edu/sympa/info/statschats](http://lists.unr.edu/sympa/info/statschats)\n\n![](StatsCartoon1.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
