Yes, faculty are more than welcome to join us (in any capacity)!   \n * **What?** Topics we have in mind include questions about Statistics, Experimental Design, Model Simulation & Analysis, Debugging R code, etc.  We may eventually narrow the focus if needed, but for now, anything you can reasonably describe as quantitative is fair game! Please plan on focusing on a single, well formed question (or two) so we can make good use of the hour.   \n * **When?** TBD\n\n\n\n\n",
