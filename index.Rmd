## About

$Stats Chats$ is an informal weekly gathering to discuss any quantitative questions you may have related to your research. 

 * **Who?** Anyone who wants to join in and attempt to improve their quantitative skills, or share their knowledge and experience. Faculty are more than welcome to join us (in any capacity)!   
 * **What?** Topics we have in mind include questions about Statistics, Experimental Design, Model Simulation & Analysis, Debugging R code, etc.  We may eventually narrow the focus if needed, but for now, anything you can reasonably describe as quantitative is fair game! Please plan on focusing on a single, well formed question (or two) so we can make good use of the hour. Occasionally we will host informational sessions on a range of topics, which will be listed on this website! Let us know if you have any ideas for topics! 
 * **When?** Tuesdays from 11 to noon
 * **Where** FA 144 (Biology conference room)
