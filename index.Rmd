## About

$Stats Chats$ is an informal weekly gathering to discuss any quantitative questions you may have related to your research. 

 * **Who?** Anyone who wants to join in and attempt to improve their quantitative skills, or share their knowledge and experience. Yes, faculty are more than welcome to join us (in any capacity)!   
 * **What?** Topics we have in mind include questions about Statistics, Experimental Design, Model Simulation & Analysis, Debugging R code, etc.  We may eventually narrow the focus if needed, but for now, anything you can reasonably describe as quantitative is fair game! Please plan on focusing on a single, well formed question (or two) so we can make good use of the hour.   
 * **When?** TBD
